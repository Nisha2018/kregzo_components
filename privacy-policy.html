                    <p>“Cookies” are pieces of information generated by web servers and stored in your computer for future access. Cookies cannot view or retrieve data from other cookies, nor can they capture files or data stored on your computer. We, our partners, and our suppliers use cookie technology to enhance your online experience by making it easier for you to navigate through our Services or make a feature work better.</p>
                    <p>We also use cookies to track affiliates that refer you to our Services. These particular cookies are saved on your computer and collect no data from you. Generally, cookies can be disabled. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.</p>

These third-party advertisers may collect information about you and your online activities, either on the Website or on other websites, through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to understand your interests, deliver to you, advertisements that are tailored to your interests and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.</p>
                    <p>In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements were clicked. Whilst third-party advertisers will not be given access to the information you have provided to Kregzo (unless you choose to provide it to them yourself directly), please remember that kregzo does not have access to, or control over, the information these third parties may collect. The information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Policy.&nbsp;</p>
