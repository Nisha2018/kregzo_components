                    <p class="heading-2">Our Rules</p>
                    <p>Kregzo is a community supported platform aimed to bring your ideas to business.</p>
                    <p>We welcome and support ideas from a variety of categories: Smart City, Healthcare, FinTech, FashionTech, Technology, etc. Here are basic regulations every idea / business must follow:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ideas must create something to share with others.<br>Kregzo can be used to create all sorts of ideas: physical products, services. But every idea needs a plan for execution by creating something marvelous and sharing it with the world. Also at some point the creator of the idea should be able to say: “Here’s what we created. Enjoy!”</li>
                        <li>Ideas / Business must be honest and clearly presented.<br>Our community is solely built on trust and communication. Any idea / business can’t mislead people or mispresent facts, and creators should be candid about what they plan to accomplish. When an idea involves manufacturing and distributing something, a physical product, we require creators to showcase actual prototype to followers of what they are making, and we prohibit photorealistic renderings.</li>
                        <li>Ideas / Business can’t fundraise for charity.<br>While we encourage and open our services to all nonprofit social ideas to launch their businesses successfully. We prohibit ideas to raise funds to donate to a charity or for a cause. (in future) Funds raised on Kregzo must go towards facilitating the idea / business outlined by the creator on his startup page.</li>
                        <li>Business can’t involve prohibited items.<br>We do not allow any of these things.<br>We prohibit creators to offer these items as rewards / incentives to other users.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any item claiming to cure, treat, or prevent an illness or condition (whether via a device, app, book, nutritional supplement, or other means).</li>
                        <li>Contests, coupons, gambling, and raffles.</li>
                        <li>Energy food and drinks.</li>
                        <li>Offensive materials. (e.g., hate speech, encouraging violence against others, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Offering a genetically modified organism as a reward.</li>
                        <li>Live animals. Projects cannot include live animals as a reward.</li>
                        <li>Offering alcohol as a reward.</li>

                        <li>Pornographic material.</li>
                        <li>Projects that share things that already exist, or repackage a previously-created product, without adding anything new or aiming to iterate on the idea in any way.</li>
                        <li>Resale. All rewards must have been produced or designed by the project or one of its creators — no reselling things from elsewhere.</li>
                        <li>Drugs, nicotine, tobacco, vaporizers and related paraphernalia.</li>
                        <li>Weapons, replicas of weapons, and weapon accessories.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your project involves something illegal, heavily regulated, or potentially dangerous for users and it is&nbsp;not&nbsp;on this list, please&nbsp;<a href="/contact?ref=prohibited_list">contact us</a>&nbsp;before starting your project.</p>
                    <p>These rules don’t cover every possible use of Kregzo, but they explain our purpose and perspective.</p>
